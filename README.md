# cuda
my cuda programs (you'll need an NVIDIA GPU to run them)
compile these programs with nvcc <.cu filename> -o \<exec filename\>  
run them with ./\<exec filename\>  
remove less-than and greater-than brackets in the actual shell commands
all filenames without number suffixes are the final versions of their kind
